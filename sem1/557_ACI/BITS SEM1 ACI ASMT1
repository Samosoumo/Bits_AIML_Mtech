1. PEAS:
* Defining minimal possible requirements our system should have to solve the problem in given setting*

Enviornment - The start point, destination, vegetation and other obstacles, radar interference as a 2D grid
Performamce measure - Number of cells it takes to get to destination undetected. (Better measure: Route length/ straight line dist. bw start and dest.)
Sensors - Satelite signal detectors, Radar detector, user signal detector, visual/sonic input to identify vegetation laid no fly zones
Actuators - Motor control to allow drone movement, turning and altitude change.


* NOTE: before the drone takes off the user already knows the best path from local beam search and is then supposed to decide risk and send
the drone

Output: Optimal cost AS WELL AS optimal path

Data Structutes: 
Priority Queue for open list 
List for closed list
Dictionary for grid: {'rowindex_colindex': (isStart, isGoal, isExplorable, Prob1, Prob2)}

** Imp: Try - For optimal path
dict: {node: 'parent_node'} - Since we keep a closed list, each node can be added only once here. So if we go from goal to start we should be able to find the optimal path
